Problem1:
to compile for pipes IPC example: make CFLAGS=-PIPES
to compile for msg que IPC example: make CFLAGS=-MSG_Q
to compile for shared memory IPC example: make CFLAGS=-SHARED_MEM
to compile for SOCKETS IPC example: make CFLAGS=-Sockets

note:before compiling with a different CFLAG from before, use make clean first
